Code for data analysis and visualisation for my lab project

To run the first study (baseline) use the experiment1.html and experiment1.js file in JATOS. To convert the results, see converter.py 

To run the second study use experiment2.html and experiment2.js in JATOS. Analogous for experiment 3. 

All experiments have individual converter files as we've gathered slightly different results in each run.

Don't hesitate to reach out if anything in the code is unclear.
